# Export and Import Data Analysis Dashboard

Using Power Bi  I developed an Interactive Export and Import Data Analysis Dashboard.

#### Skills: Data Modelling, Power BI, Python

#### In this Dashboard, there are five sections: 
1. Overview, 2. Overall Export and Import analysis, 3. Year-wise Export and Import analysis, 4. Export Analysis, 5 Import Analysis

#### In the Overview Section, analyzed:
1. Total no. of export and import Country.
2. Type of export and import commodity
3. Total export and import value
4. Top 10 countries by export value and Top 10 countries by import value
5. Flow map of export and import country

#### In the Overall Export and Import Analysis Section, analyzed:
1. Total no. of common export and import country
2. Total no. of export and import Country.
3. Total no. of only export and total no. of only import country
4. Year-wise export and import value
5. Type of export commodity and import commodity
6. Common export and import country-wise details table by year

#### In the Year-wise Export and Import Analysis Section, analyzed:
1. Year-wise total type of export and import commodity
2. Year-wise total export and import value
3. Export value by Year and Import Value by Year
4. Details table of Country-wise type of commodity export and import, export, and import value.
5. Top 10 countries based on the type of commodity export and Top 10 countries based on the type of commodity import.
6. Year-wise top 10 commodities based on export value and Yearwise top 10 commodities based on import value.

#### In the  Export Analysis Section, analyzed:
There are two options Country wise and Commodity wise export analysis.
In the Country wise export analysis section there is a details table: Year wise each commodity's total export quantity, their unit, and total export value.
In the Commodity-wise export analysis section there is a details table:
Year wise each country's total export quantity, their unit, and total export value.

#### In the  Import Analysis Section, analyzed:
